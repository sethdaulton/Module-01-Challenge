# Module 01 Challenge

Seth Daulton

## Description

For this challenge assignment, I was tasked with adjusting the provided starter code to make it more accessible and optimized. 

I added semantic html tags to the starter code to make the site more easy to read and interpret.

My end product is more optimized and consolidated then the starter code that I was provided. Alternative text has been added to all images and icons to make this webpage more accessible to screen readers and optimizes the webpage for search engines.

I was motivated to create a more accessible webpage to learn more about code consolidation and accessibility.

I built this project to learn more about how code can be consolidated and optimized. 

The webpage is more easily read by users of the site and developers alike.

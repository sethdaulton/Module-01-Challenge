# Module 01 Challenge

## Description

For this challenge assignment, I was tasked with adjusting the provided starter code to make it more accessible and optimized. 

## Acceptance Criteria

I followed the following acceptance criteria for this challenge assignment:

- GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
- WHEN I view the source code
- THEN I find semantic HTML elements
- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
- THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- WHEN I view the icon and image elements
- THEN I find accessible alt attributes
- WHEN I view the heading attributes
- THEN they fall in sequential order
- WHEN I view the title element
- THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

My end product is more optimized and consolidated then the starter code that I was provided. Alternative text has been added to all images and icons to make this webpage more accessible to screen readers and optimizes the webpage for search engines.

I was motivated to create a more accessible webpage to learn more about code consolidation and accessibility.

I built this project to learn more about how code can be consolidated and optimized. 

The webpage is more easily read by users of the site and developers alike.
